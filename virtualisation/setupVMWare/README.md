# Setting up a Virtual Machine in VMWare

## Summary

This guide will go through how to set up a VMWare Virtual Machine, and install Arch Linux to it. I'll be making another guide for an OS such as Windows 10, which will be linked in this one after it's created.

### Prerequisites

* A computer running Windows 8 or newer, or a computer running Linux (ie. Ubuntu, Red Hat, CentOS, openSUSE, etc.)
	* Your computer must be 64-bit. Most Linux distros require this already, so if you're using any modern version of your distro, you're all set.
	* On Windows, you can check here: <a href="ms-settings:about">About your PC</a> (This link will open in your Windows Settings! If you do not want this, you can go to Settings/System/About.
* At least 20GB more than the space you'll be giving your virtual machine. *This guide is not recommended for users on machines with less than 512GB storage on their drive, unless they have an external hard drive as well!*
* At least 2GB more ram than what you'll be alotting to your virtual machine.
	* I would personally recommend giving your virtual machine 2GB ram, that seems to be enough for me.
* An Arch Linux ISO file
	* Optional sub-prerequisite: A BitTorrent client. Torrenting Arch ISOs can make the download faster for yourself and others, if you leave your client open after download.
* An internet connection
